# Object Detection Techniques

This repository demonstrates various object detection and estimation techniques using AI models. It is divided into two parts:

- **Part 1:** Focuses on basic object detection models, including single and multi-object classification, bounding box localization, and a YOLOv1 implementation.
- **Part 2:** Includes advanced AI projects for object tracking, counting, open vocabulary detection, and vehicle speed estimation.

Each part is organized with its own set of projects, and detailed instructions are available in the respective `README.md` files within each folder.

## Structure

- **`od_part1`**: Basic object detection and classification models (Single/Multi-object classification, Bounding Box Localization, YOLOv1).
- **`od_part2`**: Advanced AI projects (Object Tracking, Counting, Open Vocabulary Detection, Vehicle Speed Estimation).
